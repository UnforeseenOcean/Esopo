# Esopo

Esopo is a project to create a series of poetically or literarily interesting
esoteric programming languages. Some of these languages can be used for
practical or artistic purposes; some are just silly. For a complete description
of the project (and the reasoning behind it), check out [my post about it]( 
https://wphicks.github.io/esopo/).

Eventually, all of these languages will be implemented via Javascript
interpreters to allow people to play with them online. If you create something
interesting using one of these languages, submit a pull request, and I'll be
more than happy to post it as an example here.

## Status

Most of the original work on Esopo languages was hacked together in (fairly
ugly) Python, and the language specifications are pretty informal. I'll post
some of the Python interpreters here, but I plan to replace them with more
carefully coded Javascript interpreters as soon as I can.
